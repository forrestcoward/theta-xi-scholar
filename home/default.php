<p> Hi exec,</p>

	The site is not fully finished and there are still things I want to change and finalize before I generate usernames/password for the entire house. Before I do this, I will be clearing the databases, so any books you add now or documents you upload will be deleted. Use this as an oppurtunity to test. Please keep in mind to use either Firefox or Chrome for now.

	I'd appreciate if you can test the functionality and tell me if you find anything weird.
	All feedback is appreciated!

	Thanks,
